Test automation code not requiring a git hiook

I finally got the Slack bot working after several days of beating my head against the too-complex (IMHO)  documentation ...

What I found: you have to develop a bot, not just an app; the security token types are different ... once I finally figured that out I was almost home.

The other thing that's different in the last couple of years is that the tokens automatically expire after 12 hours and you have to regenerate them.

After that, it was a piece of cake!
